Hi, I’m Moyinoluwa, but you may call me Moyin. 
I'm currently a sophomore at The University of Texas (Austin), 
studying Management Information Systems in Business
coupled with a unique interdisciplinary liberal arts honors program called Plan II.

I’m interested in the ever-evolving world of tech, and exploring the idea of law school. 
I enjoy creating and consuming creative writing/ speech, and playing sports.
I’m currently learning how to code and interning with Google Cloud.
